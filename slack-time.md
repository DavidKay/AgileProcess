What to do during slack time
Here are a couple of ideas for what developers and testers can do in the slack time towards the end of the sprint:
 
	1. Swarm to help regression if required or possible - our number one priority is delivering what we have committed to as a team.
  
	2. Assist with the refinement of stories coming up, ensuring that the stories meet our definition of ready. We know that quality in = quality out when it comes to working on stories, and it is the team's responsibility to ensure that the tickets we work on meet our level of quality.
  
	3. Working on tickets that have been carried over from the previous sprint, with the plan to get these into Test as soon as possible so that our testers have their work spread out over the sprint as much as possible.
  
	4. Picking up technical debt from the backlog. As technical debt ideally shouldn't impact on testing, small pieces can be picked up and worked on.
  
	5. Creating technical debt tickets from work that we've done in the previous sprint.
  
	6. Documentation of existing systems. This can come in many forms from activity flow diagrams, how to test documents, architectural models - the main purpose is so that we understand how the system works, and how we use it.

	7. Preparation for the retrospective - the retro is one of the most important sprint ceremonies we have whereby we can critically think about what we would like to improve on and how we can go about doing this as a team.
  
	8. Thinking about software design of new tickets coming up - often we jump straight into writing software without thinking about the design or architecture. This is because design is a very difficult task when swarmed with other responsibilities and often take a back seat.
  
	9. Getting a head start on some spikes that are coming up in the next sprint is important as sometimes we spike and work on tickets within the same sprint. This results in work backing up and being delivered into Test towards the end of the sprint. Starting early on this can help to spread the delivery of tickets across the whole sprint.
  
	10. Working on innovation and bringing that into our workstream. This can be anything from technical coding, to automation, to Agile process related. No limits.
  
	11. Preparing to run a retro - if anyone would like to volunteer to run a retrospective or have a new idea, or would like to propose an agenda, please do so! Have a vibrant retrospective can keep things fresh and creative.
  
	12. Personal training - we need to keep our skills up in order to create great software products. We have 2 hours per week to spend on personal development, lets make sure we use it!
  
	13. Working on personal admin and catching up on your own paperwork.
