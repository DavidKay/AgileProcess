It's important to communicate the estimation process as it can mean different things to different people.

My estimates are generally for the best case scenario. This means:

Given a well-formed team of engineers with business support
Who are competent, motivated and knowledgeable in the domain
Of which delivering this into production is their top priority
I am 90% confident it will take between 2 and 6 months

Key points -
- "Well-formed team" means not a random bunch of people, but a cohesive team that has a history of working well together
- "Engineers" means developers, testers, SRE, infosec, database administrators and solution architects
- "Business support" means a business analyst, product owner, scrum master and domain experts
- "Top priority" means top priority
- The estimate range may be large due to lack of requirements or discovery. As more is discovered, we can expect the delta in the range to decrease
- The confidence level can also be read as "I am 10% confident that it will be done within 2 months", or, "I am 90% confident we will fail doing this in 2 months"
 
The reason for this approach is that it opens that line of communication with the business that expresses a high degree of confidence that the business can plan around, but a broad range.

When more discovery is done, requirements gathered, domains understood, we should expect the confidence level to remain high, but the estimate range to decrease.
