{panel:title=Technical User Story|borderStyle=dashed|borderColor=#cccccc|titleBGColor=#ffdd55|bgColor=#ffffce}
Sometimes user stories can be purely technical and should be written as such. This can be specific enough to describe the implementation, such as creating a new database table, API endpoints.

A technical user story can be seen as a task and often lays the foundation for other user stories, but it should still be independently deliverable.

Please don't use: As a database, I want to have a new table, So that I can store more data.

h2. Questions

Before refinement, the team might have a number of questions they want to ask. This space provides a way of recording those within the ticket.
h2. Technical requirements

As this is a technical user story, requirements can be specific to the implementation if need be.

Supporting documentation, for example front-end designs, or technical specifics, are included later.

A list of MoSCoW requirements can be direct and to the point:
 * Requirement 1
 * Requirement 2

It is sometimes good to add closing remarks to requirements too.
h2. Out of scope

Recording what is out of scope is just as important to prevent scope creep and helps keep the team focused.
h2. Proposed solution

There is most likely going to be a proposed solution if it is not already set out in the requirements above.
h2. Acceptance Criteria

Sometimes technical user stories don't have acceptance criteria as it doesn't deliver business value.
Be wary of including acceptance criteria for the sake of including it if there is no value.
