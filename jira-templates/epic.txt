h2. Specific non-functional requirements
||Requirement||Reason||Story||
|Non-functional|Just as important as functional, this gives the team an area to think about and record the non-obvious requirements| |
|Documentation|A clear understanding of the principles design and development decisions made whilst implementing this change
will ensure that the future development and maintenance of the product is much easier.|Â |
|Feature flagging|To be used as a kill-switch in cases where the functionality of the system does not perform the way we expected it to in 
Production, and we need to quickly switch back to the previously functionality to ensure business continuity.| |
|Scalability|To be discussed.|Â |
|Performance|To ensure that the customer can complete their credit card application within a reasonable amount of time.
Circuit breakers to disable AccountScore if performance is adversely effected|Â |
|Security|To ensure data, and personally sensitive data, is stored in accordance to our data storage policies, and can only be accessed
according to those policies.|Â |
|Data retention|To ensure data can be safely removed from the system if requested.|Â |
|Monitoring|To monitor the health of the application|Â |
|Logging|To help diagnose issues we will need to log the request and response data to and from AccountScore, being sure to
omit any personally sensitive data.|Â |
|Reporting on success|It's important for the development team to know how well the product is performing in Production once gone
live. This is an important part of the feedback loop that promotes healthy iterative product development.|Â |
h2. Terms and Glossary

A credit check, and a credit search, are terminology for the same thing.

|h4. Hard credit check|A hard credit check happens when a company makes a complete search of your credit report. Each hard check is recorded on your report, so any company searching it will be able to see that youâ€™ve applied for credit.|
