h2. Questions

Before refinement, the team might have a number of questions they want to ask. This space provides a way of recording those within the ticket.


h2. Requirements

As this is a user story, requirements are to be kept ideally without implementation.

Supporting documentation, for example front-end designs, or technical specifics, are included later.

A list of MoSCoW requirements can be direct and to the point:
 * Requirement 1
 * Requirement 2

It is sometimes good to add closing remarks to requirements too.


h2. Out of scope
Recording what is out of scope is just as important to prevent scope creep and helps keep the team focused.

h2. Proposed solution

Sometimes including a short summary of a proposed solution can guide the developers towards an implementation.

h2. Acceptance Criteria

h2. Additional notes for testing
Include any information what will help out testers, such as how to test, useful SQL scripts used in development, 
screenshots of changed process - anything that you think can help.

h2. Additional resources
Any further resources to be included - such as designs, copy text, technical thoughts or resources specific to the story rather than the Epic.
