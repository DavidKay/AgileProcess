{panel:title=Reason for Spike|borderStyle=dashed|borderColor=#cccccc|titleBGColor=#ffdd55|bgColor=#ffffce}
Why has the spike been raised? What questions were asked and in what context?

For example:

As discussed in refinement of TICKET-X, we have identified different scenarios that we need to know how to respond to:
* Scenario 1
* Scenario 2

Each of these scenarios would impact the decisions made by downstream processes etc.
