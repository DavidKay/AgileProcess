# Common planning problems encountered

A non-exhaustive list of a few common issues that have discussed many times, and some proposed solutions to those.

Problem:  
- There is a number of technical concerns that are being missed off tickets.
Solution  
- Add a technical checklist to the tickets in form of either a comment or uploaded as a spreadsheet that can be updated by the developers within the team.

Problem:  
- There is a lack of clarity on how, once Live, a story can be validated in Prod causing confusion within the business.
Solution:  
- Include Validation Criteria as part of the deliverable on the story and have this signed off. This will form part of our definition of ready.

Problem:  
- Technical team members get confused as to what business problem a story is meant to solve.
Solution:  
- When creating stories, more effort should be spend on the 'why' we are doing the story, and less on the 'how'. The 'how' is an implementation issue that will be discussed in the solution design stage.

Problem:  
- Documentation on stories is reused, leading to a one-size-fits-all documentation approach which is confusing and cluttered.
Solution:  
- Each story to have well defined documented process that is clear without any prior knowledge of existing documentation.

Problem:  
- 3 Amigos sessions are expensive, provide little clarity, and have no tangible output.
Solution:  
- 3 Amigos to be limited to a small group of relevant people. Each attendee is responsible for documenting the questions or insights they have within the comments of the tickets. Further refinement gathering happens on the ticket after the Amigo session, based on comments made.

Problem:  
- There is sometimes little involvement from team members in reviewing tickets prior sprint refinement / 3 amigo sessions. This results in large quantities of questions asked within the initial session, that have to be answered in a follow-up session as opposed to being answered in the initial session.
Solution:  
- Need to understand why this isn't being done. Lack of time / too busy? Tickets too confusing? Need more warning to prioritize workload? Culture of 'not my responsibility' / 'SEP'? Do it in the session?

Problem:  
- Story's description, scope, questions, are split or referenced across multiple tickets and causes confusion when tracking down information pertinent to the problem at hand.
Solution:
- Tickets should be able to stand on their own and follow our definition of ready.

Problem:  
- Occasional story quality is questionable, with sometimes just the implementation being outlined as the description.
Solution:  
- Testing begins early in the SDLC, and quality is everyone's responsibility. If a story does not meet with the quality we expect, select team members will swarm to understand why the quality on the story is low and seek to improve it.

Problem:  
- Useful technical knowledge is not being shared across business disciplines.
Solution:  
- Business members to reach out and pair with the testing aspects to learn and glean understanding during the process. Additional effort to be reflected early in the sprint in sizing the story.

Problem:  
- Some tickets are not being prioritized and thus, not being delivered within the sprint despite being labelled as High in Jira.
Solution:  
- Implement Sprint Planning correctly, assigning tickets to developers so that everyone is aware of their expected deliverables and who is responsible.

Problem:  
- A large number of tickets are being rolled over each sprint into the next sprint.
Solution:  
- Commit to, and deliver, less stories per sprint. Use previous sprint's velocities as a guide. Under commit and over deliver.

Problem:  
- There is misunderstanding within the team on how sprints are meant to work and be managed.
Solution:  
- Find training and agree on a set of methodologies within the team.

Problem:  
- A sprint does not appear to have a set objective.
Solution:  
- Commit to delivering a few high value stories and make that the sprint goal.

Problem:  
- The background for each story is sometimes copy and pasted across multiple stories. This is to add context to the stories from a business perspective, but can sometimes be incorrect as specifics can be copied when not relevant.
Solution:  
- Find a way to manage these cross-cutting concerns of tickets at a higher level. This is generally done at the ‘feature’ level, however it appears that Jira may not be configured for this.

Problem:  
- We are spending too much time in 3-Amigos almost to the point that we are doing the actual work in the session. This results in us actually doing the "effort" in a sprint that we don't have to story points for and when that ticket we are refining comes into the next sprint, most of the work is already done, therefore is "low effort" because we've done most of it in the previous sprint. The work done in the previous sprint is not records though.
Solution:  
- Have an agenda on the 3-amigos session and just fulfil the minimum in order to understand the problem so a level that it can be pointed.

Problem:  
- Refinement sessions happen too far apart so that by the next time the session rolls around, we have forgotten what was initially discussed / questions asked in the first session.
Solution:  
- Try to have shorter refinement sessions but closer together, perhaps the next day at the same time early in the morning.

Problem:  
- Developers are spending too much time defining the business requirements as a "Developer needs to investigate how this is done and update ticket". This is with regards to Direct Payments tickets that we had to mimic the Debit behavior / implementation.
Solution:  
- A demo should be arranged to spread knowledge of the process. The responsibility should not be given to the developer. The implementation can be investigated, but the business requirements should be provided by the business.
